CAPYBARA




## Defense
<p> Capybaras protect themselves in a different way than other animals do. If they hear danger coming, they will dive into the water and hide like 'cowards'. Their natural enemies include the anaconda and the jacare. Its worst enemies are the jaguar, puma, caiman and of course MAN.</p>

## Swimming
<p> Capybaras have webbed feet like frogs and ducks do, helping them to swim fast. Plus, their eyes, ears, and nostrils are on top of their head, which lets them stay mostly submerged for long periods of time. ***Splish Splosh!*** </p>
